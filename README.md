# SecurityAsCode
This is to track my learning of an implementation of Security as Code in an Azure environment.


At the beginning of this project, I have only a rudimentary knowledge of what DevOps is, some basic experience with pipelines and truly little experience with coding or product lifecycles.

I do have a MSc in Information Security and Forensics plus experience developing a new cloud security service for SMEs based on Sentinel writing my own custom analytics rules, Workbooks and Automation so I am not entering into this as a complete amateur. 
However, it is clear to me that Security as Code managed by a DevOps environment paired with a Hub and Spoke sentinel configuration is the only authentic way to scale and ensure that the service is sustainable and delivered reliably.

The purpose is to learn publicly and track my development.
